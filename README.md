# OSDataScienceExamples
A repository of OS 'data science' code examples, demonstrating uses of the Ordnance Survey DataHub APIs.

The first set of files, for example, are all Python code that makes use of ipyleaflet.  In general, examples are orientated around the use of just one OS API, along with a source of backdrop mapping.  However, some examples may show how multiple APIs can be used together.
